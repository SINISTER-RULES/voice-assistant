Voice Assistant using Python

Things you can do using this Voice Assistant:
1. Tell the assistant to play any song and it will search for that song on YouTube and play the first result that it will get.
2. Ask him/her who is he/she and it'll tell you about itself.
3. Tell it to search something and it will give out the results in the terminal after searching it on Google.
4. Ask him/her about someone or something and it will get a paragraph from Wikipedia and read it out aloud.
5. Give it an image with text in it and it will get the text out of it using OCR and it'll read it out aloud.
